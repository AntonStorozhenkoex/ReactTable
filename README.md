# React Table 


## Lightweight and extensible data tables for React 
 Build and design powerful datagrid experiences while retaining 100% control over markup and styles.

### Designed to have zero design.

You want your tables to be powerful without sacrificing how they look! After all, what good is that nice theme you designed if you can't use it?! React Table is headless by design (it's just a hook), which means that you are in complete and full control of how your table renders down to the very last component, class or style.

### Powerful and Declarative

React Table is a workhorse. It's built to materialize, filter, sort, group, aggregate, paginate and display massive data sets using a very small API surface. Just hitch your wagon (new or existing tables) to React Table and you'll be supercharged into productivity like never before.

### Extensible

Plugins are important for a healthy ecosystem, which is why React Table has its very own plugin system allowing you to override or extend any logical step, stage or process happening under the hood. Are you itching to build your own row grouping and aggregation strategy? It's all possible!
